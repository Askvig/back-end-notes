<!-- 
    The window.screen object contains information about the user’s screen. It has the following properties:
        width
        height
        availWidth
        availHeight
        colorDepth
        pixelDepth

    All the properties above are read-only. Changing them in code won’t affect the user’s screen.

    The width and height properties return the current size of the screen. As mentioned above, they are read-only, meaning that attempting to change them won’t affect the screen size.

    The availWidth and availHeight properties return the amount of space in pixels available to the window.

    The pixelDepth and colorDepth properties return the pixel and colour depth of the screen.
