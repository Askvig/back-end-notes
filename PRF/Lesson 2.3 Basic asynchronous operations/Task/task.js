/* In this lesson, we learned about basic asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
Now we know what callbacks, timeouts and intervals are.
We can also create asynchronous code with promises.

In this task, youâ€™ll create a number guessing game.
You have to get the number from the user (via prompt) and check if the number is the same as the one you hardcoded in the JavaScript file.
If the values differ, you should ask the user again after 10 seconds.
If the values are the same, you should end the game and congratulate the user with an alert. */
